SSuite NetSurfer runs on the internal web engine of Microsoft's Edge browser, also known
as the WebView2 runtime control. The WebView2 control uses Microsoft Edge as the
rendering engine, so our application has no other connection with Microsoft's Edge
browser itself, or any other tracking or data collection built into it. WebView2 is now the
main browser engine in all the latest Windows releases.

It has recently come to light that Google is employing ex-CIA agents to help with their
data collecting and information gathering on their users. This is a major concern for
anybody using any of their services or products. This is also part why we created our
own browser that runs directly of the WebView2 runtime control. This ensures no
tracking, information collection, or any other data leaks on your browsing habits from
BigTech.

Since we are only using the WebView2 runtime control, NetSurfer runs without any overhead; like URL
click tracking, link filtering, or personal data collection. When you start NetSurfer or open a new tab, the
browser will navigate directly to your chosen homepage, which can be set from a selection of our best
web apps on the settings dialog window, unlike some other browsers which will send you to their fixed
built-in homepage filled with paid advertising which you cannot change or delete!

By using Edge's WebView2 runtime control in standalone mode, we are able to provide you with the
fastest browsing speed ever. Our browser is currently one of the fastest browsers on the net. We have
tested our browser with at least three websites that benchmark browser performance.

SSuite NetSurfer also blocks social media and website tracking from websites that you visit, but
individual cookie blocking is also available for the more paranoid out there. Just open the website in a
separate popup window by clicking on the "Window" button that can be found on the left-hand side of the
main toolbar. After the website has opened in the new popup window, click on the small lock icon next to
the address bar to change your security preferences.

We have also added a “Private Mode” browsing function to ensure complete protection against personal
data collection and tracking across website surfing. You will be completely safe from anyone trying to
track and collect your personal browsing data.

The WebView2 runtime control, for Windows 7 and 8, does not support Extensions,
this is due to security concerns. By default, WebView2 is evergreen and receives
automatic updates to help you stay on the latest and most secure surfing platform.
The WebView2 runtime control is Chromium-based for best performance and security.
Rely on an up-to-date version of Chromium with regular platform updates and
security patches.

R u n n i n g  I n s t r u c t i o n s - D e s k t o p  E d i t i o n :

Make sure the WebView2 control is installed on your system, if not or you don't wish to have
Microsoft's Edge browser installed, simply download and install the WebView2 runtime control. This
will then enable NetSurfer to run perfectly on your system.
For Your Information! - While installing NetSurfer, the installer will have an option on the last
dialog window to have the WebView2 runtime control automatically installed for you, if you have
not done so already.

Please take note - On first time startup the application will take a few extra seconds longer to open.
This is because our browser executable needs to create custom folders for the browser history, cache,
and settings. Afterwards it will run as normal.

R u n n i n g  I n s t r u c t i o n s - P o r t a b l e  E d i t i o n :

Unzip, copy, and then paste all the files into a custom folder with full writing and reading
access. This is needed to allow the browser to create its own data folders and run properly.
Make sure the WebView2 control is installed on your system, if not or you don't wish to have
Microsoft's Edge browser installed, simply download and install the WebView2 runtime control, if
you have not done so already. The installer is also included in the download file!

Please try our latest release... we've found it to be the fastest browser on the net!

yourself or test your own favourite browser to see which is the fastest!

You may be asked to restart or relaunch the browser after having changed all the settings...
Do NOT click on the "Blue Restart" button, on the bottom of the Flags page in the NetSurfer browser, after
having changed all the settings. Simply close the NetSurfer application and restart it as normal. The
Restart button on the bottom of the Internal Flags page in our NetSurfer browser does not work!
Use the below function for best user experience and performance!

We  now  ha v e  a  b u i lt-in  Ad -Bl o c ke r  f o r  o u r  b r ow s e r. . .

When you open the general "Settings" window, you will see the "Ad-Blocker" button on the bottom-right
of the screen. Click on this button to access all the options available for this feature. To enable or disable
the "Ad-Blocker" function, just select or deselect the checkbox at the top of the window.

You may also just click on the front "AdBlocker" button to view its available settings:

We have also added manual and online update buttons to keep the Ad-Blocker URL link-list up to date.
The manual update allows for either you downloading our Ad-Blocker file from our main NetSurfer web
page, or for you to add your own custom Ad-Blocker list. As long as your own data list conforms to our
list configuration e.g. one URL per line, you may upload any length of file to the list, as seen below...
Our Ad-Blocker list will be updated as frequently as possible. Any custom URLs or data files thatyou add
yourself, will be removed when you do an Online Update.

If you have downloaded our NetSurfer Extreme Edition... you may now install third-party extensions in
the "manifest.json - v3.0" file format. You may find more extensions on GitHub. Not all extensions are
compatible with our browser, unfortunately. Our latest browser is also only compatible with Windows 10
and up, due to the fact that the latest WebView2 runtime update does not support Windows 7 or 8.

SSuite NetSurfer Extreme Edition Supports Extensions from our own Extension Library!

On the far left of the toolbar, you will find the following drop-down menu filled with our best online PWA
software.

When clicking on any of the web apps, they will open in the current visible window tab.
All of the above listed web apps are all Cloudless software, meaning when downloaded and ready to run,
it stays inside the browser, on your computer, and does NOT require any further internet connection,
except for the Weather, Speed Check, and Stock market apps which obviously require an internet
connection to provide you with live data.

S o me  mo r e  hi d d en  s y s t em  c a l l s . . .

On the far right of the toolbar, you will find the following drop-down menu as seen in the below image.
You will find some useful direct browser and system calls for Windows here.

The "Refresh and Restart NetSurfer" option is most useful when you have plenty of tabs open and don't
want to close them all manually. Just click on this option and NetSurfer will close the whole browser and
start a new fresh instance and you may restart your web surfing all over again.

The "Access Internet Router" or the "Access NAS Device" option will open a new tab and navigate to the
IP address that you've set on the "Settings" window, as seen in the below image. This will automatically
open your internet router or NAS device's web interface login web page for direct instant access.

Ad-Blocking Hiccups and Solutions

If you experiencing any problems on a website with downloads or video streaming, it might be their AdBlocking detection causing havoc with your viewing or downloads. Simply right-click on the address bar
and add the website to the Ad-Blocking Whitelist and click refresh. This should solve your problem
instantly.

If you've been busy browsing the internet for a while, you would probably notice that you have a few or
maybe a lot of tabs open. It can be quite the hassle to close all those tabs and starting over again with
your surfing activities.

That's why we added this little function to our browser, just click on the the right-most drop-down menu
and select the "Refresh and Restart NetSurfer" option. This action will close all your tabs in one go and
restart NetSurfer completely fresh.

SSuite PC-Drop is now included with SSuite NetSur fer Browser...

SSuite PC-Drop makes it extremely easy to transfer/copy all files, documents, or images from an Android
smartphone to any Windows PC that is connected to your local Wi-Fi network. This application uses
direct Peer-To-Peer FTP(File Transport Protocol) communications for data transfers over your local Wi-Fi
network.

Any local wireless network your smartphone is connected to may be used for data transfer. All devices
with an IPv4 address that are connected to your local Wi-Fi network are able to send or receive files with
SSuite PC-Drop. There is NO need for an internet connection or any registered cloud account for
background syncing of data between devices.

There are 3 methods of transfer; Phone-To-Phone | Phone-to-Windows PC | Windows-to-Windows

There are two applications available for download. There is the Android app file (APK) and then there is
the Windows WIN32 executable program in 32bit and 64bit versions.

Simply unzip the file and copy and paste them wherever you find best. SSuite PC-Drop uses the standard
Android "Documents Folder" as the default folder to send and receive files from.

On your Windows system the program uses your "Public Documents" folder to send and receive files from.
For user-friendliness operation, simplicity, and security reasons, the file paths are not allowed to be
changed, this will ensure that you know where the files are being sent or received to.

Quick Tip! 😎 😏

If you don't know your smartphone's IP address, simply send a file, any small file, from
your smartphone to your Windows PC running the Windows edition of PCDrop. The sent
file will enable to show your smartphone's IP address in the sender's IP address editbox of
the Windows edition of PCDrop.

When running the Windows edition of PCDrop, the program will automatically show your Windows PC's
IP address on the top center of the program's window. Send your file to that address for a quick reminder
what your smartphone's IP address is.

If you don't have a local Wi-Fi router or network, simply switch on your
smartphone's Wi-Fi hotspot to create a local Wi-Fi peer-to-peer connection. Connect
other smartphones to your Wi-Fi hotspot and start transferring files directly over
your smartphone's Wi-Fi hotspot.

Quick Tip 2 😎 😏

J u s t  F Y I  on  o u r  H o me p a g e  s e l e c ti ons . . .

If you have one of our virtual desktops set as your homepage, you first need to
navigate your homepage tab to another web page before closing. If you don't do this,
the browser will not clear all the necessary memory in Windows and will create
problems when running a new instance of NetSurfer.

Simply select one of the web apps from the left-most drop-down menu to change the homepage before
closing your browser. This was never a problem before, but Microsoft changed the internal functions of
the WebView2 control, preventing proper shutdown. I would suggest not using our virtual desktops as a
homepage but as a web application, unless you are also willing to do the above actions when closing the
browser(including being used as an app) to ensure proper running of new NetSurfer instances.

S t a r t  p r o t e c ting  y o u r  ne t w o rk  c onne c ti on:

1. Before you start doing anything, you will need to change your DNS server settings on your network
connection to the internet. Go to your network connections in the Windows Control panel and open
its network properties dialog window. In the dialog window, you need to change the DNS server
addresses to a server that supports encrypted connections over HTTPS.

...Or simply use the following menu function in NetSurfer to open your Network connections...

In our example we will be changing it to CloudFlare's servers e.g. Preferred 1.1.1.1. and Alternate
1.0.0.1 - Below you will see what you need to change to begin...
